This folder will contain the Next.js frontend for the project.

Quick start (locally, after scaffolding):

1. cd frontend
2. npx create-next-app@latest . --use-npm (or create your code manually)
3. npm run dev

When ready to deploy, push this directory to Vercel and set the build command to `npm run build` and output to `.next`.
